    <section id="Intro">
        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>Code to Cope is an online platform aimed at encouraging mental wellbeing through STEM education. Here youâ€™ll
            be introduced to a variety of techniques that are used heavily in the computing sciences, like data
            structures, sound synthesis, and hardware.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Basics">
        <h1>Basics</h1>
        <p>p5.js is a library built on JavaScript, a programming language that drives almost all interactivity on the
            web. This section will walk you through some basic features found specifically within p5.js, but have
            applications in all programming languages.</p>
        <p><strong>Setup</strong></p>
        <p>Every p5.js script starts execution with a setup() function, and the draw() function redraws the canvas every
            frame to update the image. With these two functions, you can do almost anything within p5.js.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Variables">
        <h1>Variables</h1>
        <p>Variables are defined using either let or var (though it is best practice to stick with one when writing your
            sketch). For example:</p>
        <p>let name = &lsquo;Bob&rsquo;;</p>
        <p>let animal = &lsquo;lizard&rsquo;;</p>
        <p>let sentence = name + &lsquo; has a pet &lsquo; + animal;</p>
        <p>There are a few data types to be aware of:</p>
        <p><strong>Boolean</strong> - true or false values</p>
        <p><strong>String</strong> - characters or words</p>
        <p><strong>Number</strong> - a whole or decimal number</p>
        <p><strong>Objects</strong> - collections of related data (called properties)</p>
        <p>JavaScript (and thus p5.js) is a dynamically typed language, which means that the boundaries between data
            types are fluid. Numbers may be used as booleans, which may also be used as strings and vice versa, etc. For
            example, &ldquo;help&rdquo; + 5 would give us &ldquo;help5,&rdquo; as the &ldquo;5&rdquo; gets turned into a
            string.</p>
        <p>Some special notation to be aware of:</p>
        <p>A number variable followed by ++ (i.e. x++) means that this variable is to be incremented by one. It is
            simply shorthand for saying x = x + 1. This also applies to using something like x--, which means to
            decrement by 1.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Functions">
        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>p5.js provides some special functions that make drawing easier, such as:</p>
        <p>ellipse(x, y, width, height) for drawing ellipses and circles</p>
        <p>rect(x, y, width, height) for drawing rectangles and squares</p>
        <p>fill(red, green, blue) for filling a shape with a specified color</p>
        <p>line(x1, y1, x2, y2) for drawing a line between two points</p>
        <p>random(maximum) for generating a random number up to the given maximum</p>
        <p>&hellip; and many more!</p>
        <p>You can also define your own function as follows:</p>
        <p>function functionName (parameters) {</p>
        <p>&hellip; // body of your function</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>Functions are useful for defining chunks of code that will be used or repeated many times in your program.
            Another useful keyword to know is <strong>return</strong>. When returning from a function, you can provide a
            value that can be used outside of the function itself. For example:</p>
        <p>function add5 (number) {</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return number + 5;</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>var newValue = add5(10); // this will return 15, setting newValue to 15</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Special Structures">
        <h1>Special Structures</h1>
        <p>One important structure is the<strong> if-else </strong>statement, illustrated below:</p>
        <p>if (score &gt; 50)&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;isPassingGrade = true;</p>
        <p>else {</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;isPassingGrade = false;</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>This can be read as: if score &gt; 50, then &ldquo;isPassingGrade&rdquo; equals true, else
            &ldquo;isPassingGrade&rdquo; equals false. The if-else statement is called a conditional, because it relies
            on given conditions to determine the next step. These statements can take on many forms, and offer an
            in-between step called &ldquo;else if&rdquo; as well. You can use as many &ldquo;if&rsquo;s&rdquo; as you
            want, followed by as many &ldquo;else-if&rsquo;s&rdquo;, but only a single &ldquo;else.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><strong>Loops </strong>are another very important concept in programming. The idea of a loop is to do a set
            of instructions repeatedly.</p>
        <p>There are two main types of loops:</p>
        <p>A <strong>while </strong>loop:</p>
        <p>while(light = &ldquo;green&rdquo;) {</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;canGo = true;</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>And a <strong>for </strong>loop:</p>
        <p>for(var index = 0; index &lt; numberOfLoops; index++) {</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doSomeTask();</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>The for loop also has another variant called the <strong>for-in </strong>loop:</p>
        <p>for(var number in numArray) {</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum = sum + number;</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>The for loop requires three things: a starting condition, an ending condition, and a step.</p>
        <p>Important note on looping: beware of infinite loops! An infinite loop is one that will continue endlessly,
            and has no escape parameter. Not all infinite loops are bad under specific cases. All video games also run
            on a special loop, and even your p5.js sketch is running on an infinite loop to draw every frame. Though
            this is the case, they are generally avoided as they can easily crash a program. Make sure that your loops
            will eventually end by carefully checking their conditions before you run them!</p>
