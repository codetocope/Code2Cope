        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>p5.js also has a sound library called p5.sound that makes it easy to create and interact with audio in your
            browser. In this section weâ€™ll look at some of the tools that p5.sound provides, as well as some of the math
            behind it all.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Functions">
        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>This is a basic list of some of the things that p5.sound has to offer. For a more comprehensive list of
            p5.sound functions, <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">click here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>p5.Oscillator() </strong>- creates an Oscillator object, provided with a frequency and a type. We
            will learn more about frequencies and waveforms in the next section.</p>
        <p><strong>p5.SoundRecorder()</strong> - creates a Sound Recorder that allows you to record and playback your
            own sounds.</p>
        <p><strong>p5.Delay()</strong> - adds delay to a sound, making it start later</p>
        <p><strong>filter()</strong> - filters out frequencies from a specific cutoff point</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Frequencies and Synthesis">
        <h1>Frequencies and Synthesis</h1>
        <p><strong>Sound synthesis </strong>is the process of creating and combining sounds using digital components.
            One method is by combining waves of different frequencies.</p>
        <p><strong>Frequency </strong>- the number of times a wave repeats in a single time unit. Higher frequencies are
            higher in pitch, while lower frequencies are lower in pitch. For example, an &ldquo;A&rdquo; note is usually
            represented as 440Hz (read: &ldquo;440 Hertz&rdquo;). You will notice that if you play a piano
            &ldquo;A&rdquo; note alongside the frequency of 440Hz, it doesn&rsquo;t sound exactly the same. That&rsquo;s
            because piano notes are actually extremely complicated, and mix other frequencies in the form of
            <strong>overtones</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Waveform </strong>- the shape of the wave. There are many different waveforms, like <strong>sine
            </strong>waves, <strong>sawtooth </strong>waves, <strong>triangle </strong>waves, and <strong>square
            </strong>waves. The shape of the wave also affects the kind of sound it makes. The most common of these is
            the sine wave.</p>
